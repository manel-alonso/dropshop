              Pluvia clothing is made of a small independant group made with 4 members, of which two of them do the creation process (hand crafting, shipment) while the other two are in charge of running the website and marketing.

              Our vision is to make an impact on the world by offering real hand made products made by us instead of large organizations destroying millions of lives in 3rd world countries. For this we want to ensure also exclusivity on our products by limiting the amount we made and to ensure the quality of our pieces.
              We're also giving 10% of our profits as donations to organizations that prevent child abuse from happening.
